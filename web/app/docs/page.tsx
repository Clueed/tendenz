					<H2>statistical significants: z-score</H2>
					<P>
						When we talk about statistical significance, we are referring to the
						concept of the z-score. The z-score indicates how many standard
						deviations (Ïƒ) a particular data point is away from the mean of the
						data set. This means it not only considers the distance from the
						mean, which reflects the central tendency, but also takes into
						account the average deviation or volatility, which characterizes the
						spread or dispersion of the data.
					</P>
					<P>
						Suppose we look at a typically volatile stock like Tesla (TSLA) and
						typically very stable stock like Pfizer (PFE). Both their share
						prices increase by 10% from yesterday to today. For Pfizer, that
						would be exciting, but it wouldn&apos;t be as surprising for Tesla.
					</P>
					<P>
						The z-score is like a special way to tell how extraordinary
						something is. If we use the z-score for Tesla&apos;s jump, it might
						not be that high because it consideres to those big swings in the
						past. But if we use it for Pfizer&apos;s jump, it might be much
						higher because it doesn&apos;t usually move so much.
					</P>
					<P>
						So, the z-score helps us see how different a stock&apos;s movement
						is compared to its usual ups and downs. By applying it to a whole
						market and calculating it for each individual asset, it provides a
						simple way to distill the most interesting price movements, taking
						into account the typical ups and downs of each stock, in contrast to
						looking at just the biggest winners or losers.
					</P>
					<H3>our calculation method</H3>
					<P>
						To calculate the Z-Score, we use logarithmic returns. Logarithmic
						returns have useful qualities in this context, including symmetry
						around zero and additivity over time.
					</P>
					<P>
						To determine the Z-Score for a specific financial asset&apos;s
						recent return (from the day before yesterday to yesterday), we
						follow these steps:
						<OL>
							<LI>
								Calculate the daily logarithmic return for the last two years.
							</LI>
							<LI>Find the average and standard deviation of these returns.</LI>
							<LI>Plug the most recent return X into the Z-Score formula.</LI>
						</OL>
					</P>
					<P>
						z-score formula:
						<div className="my-1 flex justify-center">
							Z-Score = (X - Mean) / Standard Deviation
						</div>

					<H2>market capitalization</H2>
					<P>
						Market capitalization (market cap) is a financial metric that
						represents the total value of a publicly traded company. It is
						calculated by multiplying the current market price of one share of
						the company&apos;s stock by the total number of shares.
					</P>
					<H3>our calculation method</H3>
					<P>
						<UL>
							<LI>
								<B>weighted shares outstanding:</B> When available, we use
								weighted shares outstanding as the primary basis for calculating
								market capitalization. Weighted shares outstanding consider
								different share classes and their respective ownership
								percentages, providing a more comprehensive and realistic market
								cap figure.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								<B>share class shares outstanding:</B> If weighted shares
								outstanding data is not available, we use the share class shares
								outstanding of the respective share class. This approach helps
								us account for the differences in market values and voting
								rights that may exist between various share classes.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								<B>&quot;as-is&quot; market capitalization:</B> In situations
								where neither weighted shares outstanding nor share class shares
								outstanding data is available, we resort to using the market
								capitalization &quot;as-is&quot; from our data providers.
								However, this approach might not reflect the complete picture
								due to the absence of insights into its underlying calculation.
							</LI>
						</UL>
					</P>
					<H3>staleness</H3>
					<P>
						Given the way in which data is made available to us, some market
						capitalization figures may become stale or outdated over time.
						Market cap values can fluctuate frequently based on changes in stock
						prices and the number of outstanding shares. While we strive to
						maintain accurate and up-to-date data, users should be aware that
						market cap figures may not always reflect real-time market
						conditions. It&apos;s advisable to verify the currency of the data
						when making investment decisions or conducting financial analysis.
